            <h2 class="secondary-header">About Me</h2>
            <p class="styling">
                I was born in Lima, Peru and my family moved to the US when I was 7.
                Ever since I was little, I've loved solving puzzles and figuring out how things worked.
                I wanted to know, how a computer worked, why it functioned the way it did, and how I could be someone who makes applications for others.
                <br/><br/>
                Without knowing too much about it, I went to school for Computer Engineering thinking it would be a step in the direction I wanted to take my life.
                Unfortunately for me, Computer Engineering didn't have as much programming as I'd like so I switched to Computer Science. 
                I ended up not finishing the degree due to some personal issues, but the itch to program never left me, bug fixing is fun for me!
                <br/> <br/> 
                Since then I've worked in retail and food service for about a decade. 
                Through that I've gained experience in managing groups, monetary stewardship, and adapting to the current situation on the fly.
                I've decided to get back into the a world of development and programming.
                Through this bootcamp I hope to refresh and learn some new skills that I didn't have before to go into the developement field.
